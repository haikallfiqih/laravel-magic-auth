# Contributing to Laravel Magic Auth

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Laravel Magic Auth as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/haikallfiqih/laravel-magic-auth/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/haikallfiqih/laravel-magic-auth/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Process

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests: `composer test`
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
6. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/my-feature`
7. Submit a pull request

### Testing

```bash
composer test
```

### Coding Style

We follow the PSR-12 coding standard and the PSR-4 autoloading standard.

```bash
composer check-style
composer fix-style
```
